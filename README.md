# 100 Days of Machine Learning Practice 🚀  

Welcome to the **100 Days of ML Practice** repository! 🎯 This initiative is designed to help reinforce machine learning concepts through daily coding exercises, projects, and challenges.  

## 📌 What is this repository about?  
This repository serves as a **learning log** where I will document my daily progress in machine learning. Each day, I will:  
✔️ Solve ML problems using Python 🐍  
✔️ Explore datasets and apply different ML algorithms 📊  
✔️ Implement ML techniques with libraries like Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, and TensorFlow 🤖  
✔️ Share insights, solutions, and code snippets to help others learn along with me  

## 🎯 Goals  
🔹 Build a strong foundation in ML concepts  
🔹 Improve practical problem-solving skills  
🔹 Develop real-world ML models  
🔹 Stay consistent with coding practice  

## 🏆 How This Works  
- 📅 **Daily Practice**: A new ML task or concept will be tackled each day  
- 📂 **Structured Learning**: Organized into topics like Regression, Classification, Clustering, NLP, etc.  
- 💡 **Mini-Projects**: Applying ML techniques to real-world datasets  
- 📝 **Documentation**: Explanations, learnings, and notes alongside code  

## 🚀 Get Involved!
